# Python

Recommend static analysis tools for a Python project that focus on security vulnerabilities.

I need a quick review of Pylint with key features and limitations. Also include a sample Bandit command to scan a Python project.

How do I implement Bandit for a Python project built with VS Code?

How do I integrate Bandit into my CI/CD pipeline for automated security checks with GitHub Actions? 

How can I integrate multiple Python security and quality analyzers (Bandit, Semgrep, pip-audit or safety, Ruff/Pylint) to produce SARIF, de-duplicate overlapping findings, and enforce severity-based PR gating (including baseline handling for legacy code)?

How do I implement Python supplyâ€‘chain hardening: locked and hashed dependencies (pip-tools or poetry export with --hash), SBOM generation (CycloneDX), provenance / attestations (SLSA / GitHub OIDC), and dependency vulnerability diffing in CI with artifact retention?

What is an advanced secure development workflow combining type enforcement (mypy strict), runtime audit hooks (PEP 578/551), secret scanning pre-commit, Semgrep custom rules, and differential scanning (changed files only) with performance-conscious GitHub Actions caching?
